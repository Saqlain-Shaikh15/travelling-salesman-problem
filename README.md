Explore the Traveling Salesperson Problem with an interactive Indian map. Choose your starting city and any combination of 10 key Indian cities. The application then finds the most efficient route connecting them all (returning to the start), displaying the optimized path on the map and calculating the total shortest distance.

For running this, run the app.py code on your local machine.
